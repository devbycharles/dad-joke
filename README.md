## Project
- In this project, I built a dad joke generator using an API. No design assets were used in the creation of this project. Developed to connect to backend APIâ€™s through async, await and fetch. All desgins were made by me.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript ES6+
- Materialize

### What I learned

- How to connect a API using async, await and fetch

### Continued development

- No changes for the foreseeable future
